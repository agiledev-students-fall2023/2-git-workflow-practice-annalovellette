## What I Found Interesting
This article highlights Canada's rapid success in attracting foreign tech workers from the U.S. through a fast-track work-permit program. Within just 48 hours, they reached their target of 10,000 applicants seeking permanent residency. This initiative addresses the challenges faced by H-1B visa holders in the U.S., offering them more security and opportunities in Canada. It also underscores the substantial contribution of the tech sector to Canada's economy and its potential for further growth. Overall, Canada's proactive approach to talent acquisition and its simplified immigration system are positioning it as a global leader in attracting tech talent and fostering tech hubs like Toronto, while potentially taking top talent away from the US.
